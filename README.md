Not yet ready still setting up

# DefSP
A clean starter Defold project with useful defaults and includes to help speed up new projects so that you do not have to setup everything over again for each new project. 

This project is setup for my personal needs first. Feel free to fork it to create a version for your tastes and needs to share.

## Installation

Download a copy of this project and and open its game.project with Defold.

Perhaps Defold in the future will include ability to create new projects based on zips? And subscribe to project template zips based on git urls?

## Features

This starter project has these features:
* Fixed aspect ratio render script
* This version is meant for portrait based projects with resolution of 640x1136 (making it fully res and orientation agnostic is TODO)
* game.input populated with most useful keys
* Screen system setup : start, main menu, game, settings, about, sub menu (NOT SETUP YET)
* Resource folder hierarchy 
* Screen fading to and from a solid color based on an overlay
* Make solid color overly (such as black) appear between GUI layers / above game layer
* Multi language localization support with autofit for text

## Dependencies

These are already setup in the project but listed here for reference.
